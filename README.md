# Delaunay Triangulation - Implementation and Comparison

A comprehensive implementation of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm using the Bowyer-Watson method, with comparison to scipy's implementation and detailed statistical analysis.

## Description

This project implements the Delaunay triangulation algorithm from scratch using the Bowyer-Watson method and compares it with scipy's built-in implementation. Delaunay triangulation is a method of dividing a plane into triangles such that no point lies inside the circumcircle of any triangle.

The project provides tools for:
- Custom implementation of the Bowyer-Watson algorithm
- Performance comparison with scipy.spatial.Delaunay
- Statistical analysis of triangulation quality
- Comprehensive visualization of results

## Features
